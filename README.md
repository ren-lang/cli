# ren-cli

ðŸš¨ **Not safe for public consumption.**

## Setup

```
$ npm i
$ npm run build && npm run link
$
```

## Todo

-   [ ] Allow `ren run` to take a source file to execute rather than a directory.
-   [ ] Do something useful with errors.
-   [ ] Ignore the `.ren/deps` directory during compilation.
-   [ ] Have something analogous to `package.json` for project config.
-   [ ] Do something other than "copy the compiled javascript of stuff i made for advent of code" for the stdlib.
